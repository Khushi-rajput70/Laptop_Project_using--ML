💻 Laptop Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting the price of laptops based on their specifications using Machine Learning techniques.
The dataset contains features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, GPU, screen size, operating system, and more. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate laptop prices.

⚙ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering for better prediction

Implementation of regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation
